# Description
UrBnb (Server and Database Optimization): PostgreSQL | Express | Node.js | Nginx
- Load Testing: Artillery.io | Loader.io | New Relic
- Deployment: EC2 | Docker

UrBnb was a System Design project I worked on with three other engineers. To give a high level overview, our group inherited a full-stack application previously built by another team (in our case, a replica of AirBnb's product page). The front-end of this application was entirely built out, so our job was to optimize and scale the back-end. My role, in particular, was to optimize the unit details microservice.

As it would be difficult to see the impact of my work by going through this repo, I've put together a brief summary of the project below (as well as a screenshot of the microservice and a diagram of our final deployment architecture).
